README FOR Sys::Utmp

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

The module requires that your system's C libraries export the functions
getutent(), setutent() and endutent() - if make complains that it can't find
these functions and you know that they exist then you may have to supply the
LIBS directive to Makefile.PL to include the appropriate library:

   perl Makefile.PL LIBS='-lc'

for example.

If your system doesnt have these functions and Makefile.PL doesnt detect
that it should try to supply them itself then you might try :

   perl Makefile.PL DEFINE='-DNOUTFUNCS'

which will force the module to use its built in versions of the functions.

At version 1.6 Test::More is also required for the tests.
